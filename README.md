We demonstrate how consumer behavior can determine whether they will default on a vehicle loan or not. The models consider two classes as Class 1 & Class 2 i.e., p1+p2 = 1 for every predictor to find the predictor and split the value that partitions the data into two groups: Class 1 & Class 2 such that the overall sums of squares errors are minimized modification.  
A model comparison table on Classification Tree, Logistic Regression, Random Forest displays data preprocessing for Box-Cox Transformation (11); Centering (26); Ignored (4); Scaled (26).
